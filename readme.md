# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2019 :christmas_tree:
:warning: This repo is under construction :warning:

My attempt at Advent of Code 2019.
This is primarily for fun and to procrastinate my actual research and coursework.
As a result, solutions will mostly be in Python or whatever I feel like, and the solutions given may sacrifice efficiency for elegance or laziness.
Eventually, I may update more optimal solutions to some problems.
