My attempt at Advent of Code 2019.
This is primarily for fun and to procrastinate my actual research and coursework.
As a result, solutions will mostly be in Python or whatever I feel like, and the solutions given may sacrifice efficiency for elegance or laziness.
Eventually, I may update more optimal solutions to some problems.
